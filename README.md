# C64 GFX Convert

[Open the converter](https://rogeralsing.github.io/c64gfxconvert/)

A browser-based Commodore 64 image converter with FLI, IFLI, AFLI, NUFLI,
PAFLI, hires and multicolor bitmap modes, optional virtual colors, sprite
overlays, and native exports. Image processing stays in your browser.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build step or server is required.

## Layers

Build one image from several source images, with separate conversion settings
for each layer. For example, put scenery on the bottom layer and figures with
a transparent background on a layer above it. Transparent pixels reveal the
layers below. The screenshot above shows both layers combined; these views
show each layer on its own:

| Background layer only | Foreground layer only |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/images/c64-studio-background-layer.png" alt="Scenery layer visible with the figures layer hidden" width="480"> | <img src="assets/images/c64-studio-foreground-layer.png" alt="Figures layer visible with the scenery layer hidden" width="480"> |

**Image** settings apply to the whole composition: graphics format, background
color where the format supports it, and the hardware sprite color in sprite
modes. All layers use the same graphics format.

Select a layer in **Layers** to edit its source image, position, scale,
brightness, contrast, levels, hue, saturation, noise, interlace, dithering,
virtual colors, palette limits, excluded colors, and sprite matching. Changes
apply only to the selected layer, so you can tune figures and scenery
independently.

- Click **New**, then **Choose image**, to add a source image to a new layer.
- Layers paint from bottom to top. Use the arrows to change their order.
- Click an eye to hide or show a layer without deleting it.
- Use **Duplicate** to start from an existing layer, or **Delete** to remove one.
- Double-click a selected layer name, or press **F2**, to rename it.
- Drag the preview to move the selected layer, or use **Scale**, **Position X**,
  and **Position Y** for precise placement.

Visible layers combine into one image before the final C64 tile restrictions
are applied. The preview and native export use that same fitted result.

## Projects

Use **Save project** to download a JSON file containing all layers, their source
images, and their settings. **Open project** restores that file, including layer
order, visibility, the active layer, shared graphics settings, and preview options.
Images are embedded in the JSON, so the original files are not needed to reopen
it. Larger source images produce larger project files. Projects stay local.

Download [DutchBreezeRemake](examples/DutchBreezeRemake.json), then choose
**Open project** to explore the layered example shown above.

## Tests

```sh
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
```

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages publishes the repository root from `main`. Pushes to `main`
automatically update the site. The `.nojekyll` file serves the static app
without Jekyll processing.
